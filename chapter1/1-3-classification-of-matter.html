title: 1.3 Classification of Matter

---
<p>
  Matter can be classified by it's <em>state</em>.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Solids</strong> have a set volume and shape.The inter molecular force of attraction for solid matter is very strong.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Liquids</strong> have a set volume, but change shape. The inter molecular force of attraction for liquid matter is weaker than solid matter.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gases</strong> have neither definite volume nor shape. The inter molecular force of attraction for gaseous matter is negligible.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plasma</strong> which are usually gaseous state of matter in which a part or all of the atoms or molecules are dissociated to form ions.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Matter can also be classified by its <em>chemical composition</em>.

      An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element" target="_blank">element</a> is a pure substance made up of atoms with the same number of protons. As of 2011, 118 elements have been observed, 92 of which occur naturally. Carbon (C), Oxygen (O), Hydrogen (H) are examples of elements. The <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General_Chemistry/Periodic_Table" target="_blank">periodic table</a> is a tabular representation of the known elements.</p>

            <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound" target="_blank">compound</a> consists of two or more chemical elements that are chemically bonded together. Water (H2O) and table sugar (C12H22O11) are examples of chemical compounds. The ratio of the elements in a compound is always the same. For example in water, the number of H atoms is always twice the number of O atoms.</p>

      A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mixture" target="_blank">mixture</a> consists of two or more substances (element or compound) mixed together without any chemical bond. Salad is a good example. A mixture can be separated into its individual components by mechanical means.
