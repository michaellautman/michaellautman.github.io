<p>
  Matter can be classified by it's <em>state</em>.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Solids</strong> have a set volume and shape.The inter molecular force of attraction for solid matter is very strong.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Liquids</strong> have a set volume, but change shape. The inter molecular force of attraction for liquid matter is weaker than solid matter.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gases</strong> have neither definite volume nor shape. The inter molecular force of attraction for gaseous matter is negligible.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plasma</strong> which are usually gaseous state of matter in which a part or all of the atoms or molecules are dissociated to form ions.
    </li>
