title: 1.3 Classification of Matter

---
<p>
  Matter can be classified by it's <em>state</em>.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Solids</strong> have a set volume and shape.The inter molecular force of attraction for solid matter is very strong.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Liquids</strong> have a set volume, but change shape. The inter molecular force of attraction for liquid matter is weaker than solid matter.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gases</strong> have neither definite volume nor shape. The inter molecular force of attraction for gaseous matter is negligible.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plasma</strong> which are usually gaseous state of matter in which a part or all of the atoms or molecules are dissociated to form ions.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Matter can also be classified by its <em>chemical composition</em>.

      An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element" target="_blank">element</a> is a pure substance made up of atoms with the same number of protons. As of 2011, 118 elements have been observed, 92 of which occur naturally. Carbon (C), Oxygen (O), Hydrogen (H) are examples of elements. The <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General_Chemistry/Periodic_Table" target="_blank">periodic table</a> is a tabular representation of the known elements.</p>

            <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound" target="_blank">compound</a> consists of two or more chemical elements that are chemically bonded together. Water (H2O) and table sugar (C12H22O11) are examples of chemical compounds. The ratio of the elements in a compound is always the same. For example in water, the number of H atoms is always twice the number of O atoms.

    </li>
    <li>
      A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mixture" target="_blank">mixture</a> consists of two or more substances (element or compound) mixed together without any chemical bond. Salad is a good example. A mixture can be separated into its individual components by mechanical means.

<h3>Types of Mixtures</h3>
<p>
  There are many kinds of <strong>mixtures</strong>. They are classified by the behavior of the <strong>phases</strong>, or <strong>substances</strong> that have been mixed.</p>

  <h4>Homogeneous Mixtures</h4>

  <p>
    A homogeneous mixture is uniform, which means that any given sample of the mixture will have the same composition. Air, sea water, and carbonation dissolved in soda are all examples of homogeneous mixtures, or solutions. No matter what sample you take from the mixture, it will always be composed of the same combination of phases. Chocolate chip ice cream is not homogeneous—one spoonful taken might have two chips, and then another spoonful might have several chips.

An example for a homogeneous mixture is a solution. The substance that gets dissolved is the solute. The substance that does the dissolving is thesolvent. Together they make a solution. If you stir a spoonful of salt into a glass of water, salt is the solute that gets dissolved. Water is the solvent. The salty water is now a solution, or homogeneous mixture, of salt and water.

When different gases are mixed, they always form a solution. The gas molecules quickly spread out into a uniform composition.

<h4>Heterogeneous Mixtures</h4>
<p>
  A <strong>heterogeneous</strong> mixture is not uniform. Different samples may have different compositions, like the example of chocolate chip ice cream. Concrete, soil, blood, and salad are all examples of heterogeneous mixtures.

    <strong>Suspensions</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    When sand gets kicked up in a pond, it clouds the water. Soon the sand settles down, and is no longer mixed into the water. This is an example of a suspension. Suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures that will eventually settle. They are usually, but not necessarily, composed of phases in different states of matter. Italian salad dressing has three phases: the water, the oil, and the small pieces of seasoning. The seasonings are solids that will sink to the bottom, and the oil and water are liquids that will separate.

    What exactly is toothpaste? We can't exactly classify it by its state of matter. It has a definite shape and volume, like a solid. But then you squeeze the tube, and it flows almost like a liquid. And then there's jelly, shaving cream, smoke, dough, and Silly Putty...
</p><p>
  These are examples of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloids" target="_blank">colloids</a>. A colloid is a heterogeneous mixture of two substances of different phases. Shaving cream and other foams are gas dispersed in liquid. Jello, toothpaste, and other gels are liquid dispersed in solid. Dough is a solid dispersed in a liquid. Smoke is a solid dispersed in a gas.
  </p>
<p>
  <strong>Colloids differ from suspensions in that they will not settle.</strong>

<h2>Methods for Separating Mixtures</h2>
<p>
  Because there is no chemical bonding in a mixture, the phases can be separated by mechanical means. In a heterogeneous mixture like a salad, the pieces can easily be picked out and separated. It is as simple as sifting through the salad and picking out all the tomatoes and radishes, for example. However, many mixtures contain particles that are too small, liquids, or too many particles to be separated manually. We must use more sophisticated methods to separate the mixture.
