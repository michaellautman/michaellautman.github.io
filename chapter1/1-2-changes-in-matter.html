title: 1.2 Changes in Matter

<p>

There are two types of change in matter: physical change and chemical change. As the names suggest, physical changes affect physical properties, and chemical changes affect chemical properties.</p>
<p>

Chemical changes are also known as chemical reactions. The "ingredients" of a reaction are the reactants, and the end results are called the "products". The change from reactants to products can be signified by an arrow.</p>

<p>
Note that the number of reactants and products don't necessarily have to be the same. However, the number of each type of atom must remain constant. This is called the Law of Conservation of Matter. It states that matter can never be created or destroyed, only changed and rearranged. If a chemical reaction begins with 17 moles of carbon atoms, it must end with 17 moles of carbon atoms. They may be bonded into different molecules, or in a different state of matter, but they cannot disappear.

  When changes occur, energy is often transformed. However, like atoms, energy cannot disappear. This is called the Law of Conservation of Energy. A simple example would be putting ice cubes into a soft drink. The ice cubes get warmer as the drink gets colder, because energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. Note that energy can be "released" or "stored" by making and breaking bonds. When a plant converts the energy from sunlight into food, that energy is stored in the chemical bonds within the sugar molecules.

<h3>Chemical Change or Physical Change?</h3>
<p>

Physical changes do not cause a substance to become a fundamentally different substance. Chemical changes, on the other hand, cause a substance to change into something entirely new. Chemical changes are typically irreversible, but that is not always the case. It is easier to understand the difference between physical and chemical changes with examples.

      <h3>State Changes Are Physical</h3>
      <p>
        Phase changes are when you melt, freeze, boil, condense, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="The transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through the intermediate liquid phases">sublimate</span>, or deposit a substance. They do not change the nature of the substance unless a chemical change occurs along with the physical change.
