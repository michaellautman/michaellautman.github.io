    <h2>The Basic Properties of Matter</h2>

<h3>What is Matter?</h3>
<p>Matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume.
Mass is a measure of an object's inertia. It is proportional to weight: the more mass an object has, the more weight it has. However, mass is not the same as weight. Weight is a force created by the action of gravity on a substance while mass is a measure of an object's resistance to change in motion. Mass is measured by comparing the substance of interest to a standard kilogram called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram" target="_blank">International Prototype Kilogram (IPK)</a>. The IPK is a metal cylinder where the height and diameter both equal 39.17 millimeters and is made of an alloy of 90% platinum and 10% iridium. Thus, the standard kilogram is defined and all other masses are a comparison to this kilogram. When atom masses are measured in a mass spectrometer, a different internal standard is used. Your take home lesson with regard to mass is that mass is a relative term judged by a comparison.</p>

<p>

Volume is a measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. Volume can be measured directly with equipment designed using graduations marks or indirectly using length measurements depending on the state (gas, liquid, or solid) of the material. A graduated cylinder, for example, is a tube that can hold a liquid which is marked and labeled at regular intervals, usually every 1 or 10 mL. Once a liquid is placed in the cylinder, one can read the graduation marks and record the volume measurement. Since volume changes with temperature, graduated equipment has limits to the precision with which one can read the measurement. Solid objects that have regular shape can have their volume calculated by measuring their dimensions. In the case of a box, it's volume equals length times width times height.
It is particularly interesting to note that measuring is different from calculating a specific value. While mass and volume can both be determined directly relative to either a defined standard or line marks on glass, calculating other values from measurements is not considered measuring. For example, once you have measured the mass and volume of a liquid directly, one can then calculate the density of a substance by dividing the mass by the volume. This is considered indirectly determining density. Interestingly enough, one can also measure density directly if an experiment which allows the comparison of density to a standard is set up.</p>

<p>
  Another quantity of matter directly or indirectly determined is the amount of substance. This can either represent a counted quantity of objects (e.g. three mice or a dozen bagels) or the indirectly determined number of particles of a substance being dealt with such as how many atoms are contained in a sample of a pure substance. The latter quantity is described in terms of <strong>moles</strong>. One mole is a specifically defined as the number of particles in 12 grams of the isotope Carbon-12. This number is 6.02214078(18)x 10<sup>23</sup> particles.

<h3>Properties of Matter</h3>
<p>
  Properties of matter can be divided in two ways: extensive/intensive, or physical/chemical.

        <strong>Extensive Properties</strong> depend on the amount of matter that is being measured. These include mass and volume.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Intensive Properties</strong> do not depend on the amount of matter. These include density and color.

        <strong>Physical Properties</strong> can be measured without changing the chemical's identity. The freezing point of a substance is physical. When water freezes, it's still H<sub>2</sub>O.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Chemical Properties</strong> deal with how one chemical reacts with another. We know that wood is flammable because it becomes heat, ash, and carbon dioxide when heated in the presence of oxygen.
