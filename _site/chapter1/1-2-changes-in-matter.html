There are two types of change in matter: physical change and chemical change. As the names suggest, physical changes affect physical properties, and chemical changes affect chemical properties.</p>
<p>

Chemical changes are also known as chemical reactions. The "ingredients" of a reaction are the reactants, and the end results are called the "products". The change from reactants to products can be signified by an arrow.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="small-4 columns centered">
    reactants $rightarrow products
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Note that the number of reactants and products don't necessarily have to be the same. However, the number of each type of atom must remain constant. This is called the Law of Conservation of Matter. It states that matter can never be created or destroyed, only changed and rearranged. If a chemical reaction begins with 17 moles of carbon atoms, it must end with 17 moles of carbon atoms. They may be bonded into different molecules, or in a different state of matter, but they cannot disappear.
